TestsService.saveTestData
   Add form fields/methods to show conflicting values when auto-merging isn't possible.
   Null value should be able to conflict with non-null value.

In sample listing, sample checkboxes should be aligned vertically to top of the sample, not the center.

Add convenience buttons to allow filling sampling method values with those from the test config.

Finish forms.
  Add exceptions note field to sampling method subform.

Make pdf of test data as part of "make package" function.

Try Material "Stepper" component to replace expansion panels for test data.

Add ability to attach files to a sample and/or test.

Add sorting and filtering capabilities to sample listing.
   Maybe add test view, maybe as table.

Allow creating a new empty test of a given type in UI for selected sample(s).
  Can add a "+ new test" next to the test count in the sample component.
  Test data field and status fields should be null.
  Should have to enter test begin date (TEST.BEGIN_DATE in db) from which day numbers are calculated.
  +TestsService.createNewTest()


test data entry component
-------------------------
  Try alternate datepicker adapter using moment.js, see if getting actual dates is an option.
  Allow pasting resource codes to be automatically matched to form fields by type.
  button to apply resources
    Highlight application points in the form.
    Distinguish applied resource codes from those that didn't match any form fields.


Decide how signatures in forms will be handled.
  They can't be handled like other form data, both components must be set automatically only when user passes an authentication test.
  Probably only the form stage should be signable as complete/correct and achieved outside the form?


[SL] Samples Listing

[WB] Waterbath whiteboard
  Add general screen to display samples/tests and attach status notes.

[R] manage lab resources
  usual crud ops

[MU] manage employees/users for user's lab group
  usual crud ops

[MLG] manage lab groups

[MTRA] manage test/lab-resource associations (managed and unmanaged)


[dto and ui] Each test view should be able to know the tests current stage, and optionally show each stage's data contents individually.
  + StagedLabTest interface
      stages: string[]
      currentStage: string
  UI will allow flipping through stages for a test.
  Grid of active tests will just show current stages by default.

Create a new service for setting page title in center of toolbar, use this to hold sample listing page title, "Samples".


Forms
  For each boolean choice, form should include a yes/no or pos/neg radio group with same form field name and values 'Y'/'N' or '+'/-'.
    Hopefully this will map naturally to the json field value of null/'+'/'-' etc.

.flexbox-ex {
   display: flex;
   flex-flow: row wrap;
   justify-content: flex-start; // main axis: flex-start/end, center, space-around, space-between, space-evenly
   align-items: stretch;        // cross axis: stretch, center, flex-start, flex-end
}
