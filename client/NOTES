Implement server side of user/password authentication and user creation.
   https://auth0.com/blog/implementing-jwt-authentication-on-spring-boot/

Audit logging of all test data changes, per field.
  Add a presentation of this log to report pdf (imp slm vidas?) which can be signed.

*** Positives need to be handled as next priority.
   Having seprate test type for positives is fine but the related tests need to be kept together and in proper sequence.
   Add test group/sequence field(s) to order and group tests within samples.

Vidas Results Grid
   Mirror num slots in vidas in Vidas stage results.
   Label rows as bays as done for actual Vidas machine.
   Use actual css grid.
   Orient radio buttons vertically.

Try linking to specific section(s) in BAM for each stage.

Pre enr - Maybe make user have to choose to enter values manually for sampling manually.
  Could just disable the sampling detail fields unless user selects an other/custom toggle.
  Run this by John again, he seemed to maybe be OK with it as it is after some discussion.

BAM Integration
   Maybe pick food etc and restrict sampling method choices based on food and BAM.

Maybe print out labels for plates and tubes, which are different from media labels.

Implement user/password auth since alternatives would require certificates and/or AD accounts which would take too much time to obtain.

Audit logging of all test data changes, per field.
  Add a presentation of this log to report pdf (imp slm vidas?) which can be signed.


Make an html report for imp slm vidas test.
  Maybe customize css for report mode.

Q: What sort of medium type codes will be the prefix for BG, I2KI batches?

Rename WRAPUP to RES-SAMP?

Vidas Stage
   Sample detections
      Allow pasting in results or loading from file (see Vidas results output).


Each test needs to be able to allow free-form entry of "continuation page".

Add filters to samples listing.

Maybe allow locking each test section.

TestsService.saveTestData
   Make sure that null value can conflict with non-null value.

Research API, try updating samples from FACTS.

Add ability to attach files to a sample and/or test.

test data entry component
-------------------------
  Allow pasting resource codes to be automatically matched to form fields by type.
  button to apply resources
    Highlight application points in the form.
    Distinguish applied resource codes from those that didn't match any form fields.


Decide how signatures in forms will be handled.
  They can't be handled like other form data, both components must be set automatically only when user passes an authentication test.
  Probably only the form stage should be signable as complete/correct and achieved outside the form?


[SL] Samples Listing

[WB] Water bath whiteboard
  Add general screen to display samples/tests and attach status notes.

[R] manage lab resources
  usual crud ops

[MU] manage employees/users for user's lab group
  usual crud ops

[MLG] manage lab groups

[MTRA] manage test/lab-resource associations (managed and unmanaged)


[dto and ui] Each test view should be able to know the tests current stage, and optionally show each stage's data contents individually.
  + StagedLabTest interface
      stages: string[]
      currentStage: string
  UI will allow flipping through stages for a test.
  Grid of active tests will just show current stages by default.

Create a new service for setting page title in center of toolbar, use this to hold sample listing page title, "Samples".


Forms
  For each boolean choice, form should include a yes/no or pos/neg radio group with same form field name and values 'Y'/'N' or '+'/-'.
    Hopefully this will map naturally to the json field value of null/'+'/'-' etc.

.flexbox-ex {
   display: flex;
   flex-flow: row wrap;
   justify-content: flex-start; // main axis: flex-start/end, center, space-around, space-between, space-evenly
   align-items: stretch;        // cross axis: stretch, center, flex-start, flex-end
}
