Commit Notes
------------
Make lab group contents access fully async in user context service.
Provide richer resolved content (LabGroupTestData) to test data entry components.
In test forms, if non-empty select list is available for a lab resource then provide select list, else text input.

Create a new type to represent data given to test data entry components, in addition to VersionedTestData.
  Also add lab group resources by type.

TestsService.saveTestData
   Null value should be able to conflict with non-null value.
   Add form fields/methods to show conflicting values when auto-merging isn't possible.

Can disable expansion panel header when only showing a single stage?

Try alternate datepicker adapter using moment.js, see if getting actual dates is an option.

test data entry component
-------------------------
  Allow pasting resource codes to be automatically matched to form fields by type.
  dialog to paste codes
  button to apply resources
    Highlight application points in the form.
    Distinguish applied resource codes from those that didn't match any form fields.

Add convenience buttons to allow filling sampling method values with those from the test config.

Allow creating a new empty test of a given type in UI for selected sample(s).
  Test data field and status fields should be null.
  Should have to enter test begin date (TEST.BEGIN_DATE in db) from which day numbers are calculated.

Decide how signatures in forms will be handled.
  They can't be handled like other form data, both components must be set automatically only when user passes an authentication test.
  Probably only the form stage should be signable as complete/correct and achieved outside the form?

John: For now, don't use resource lists, just allow pasting directly to a form section after clicking on a test stage.
      So, may not need multiple selection at all, for now.
      If selection is needed, it would probably be selection of tests not samples, for example to apply some data to
      multiple tests at once.

[SL] Samples Listing
---------------
Only show latest of saved/reviewed/synced statuses on right side, maybe show all via popup.

[WB] Waterbath whiteboard
  Add general screen to display samples/tests and attach status notes.

[R] manage lab resources
  usual crud ops

[MU] manage employees/users for user's lab group
  usual crud ops

[MLG] manage lab groups

[MTRA] manage test/lab-resource associations (managed and unmanaged)


[dto and ui] Each test view should be able to know the tests current stage, and optionally show each stage's data contents individually.
  + StagedLabTest interface
      stages: string[]
      currentStage: string
  UI will allow flipping through stages for a test.
  Grid of active tests will just show current stages by default.

Create a new service for setting page title in center of toolbar, use this to hold sample listing page title, "Samples".


Forms
  For each boolean choice, form should include a yes/no or pos/neg radio group with same form field name and values 'Y'/'N' or '+'/-'.
    Hopefully this will map naturally to the json field value of null/'+'/'-' etc.

.flexbox-ex {
   display: flex;
   flex-flow: row wrap;
   justify-content: flex-start; // main axis: flex-start/end, center, space-around, space-between, space-evenly
   align-items: stretch;        // cross axis: stretch, center, flex-start, flex-end
}
