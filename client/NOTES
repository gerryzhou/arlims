In Sample dto and data access layer, add number of associated managed/unmanaged lab resources to sample information.

Allow viewing/editing associated resource lists for each sample.
  Show counts of each as router link to detail view or lazy-loaded expansion panel(s).


Consider relaxing requirement that resources are associated only with tests specifically.
  User may not have created tests before wanting to associate resources with samples.
  We already need to ask the user whether to apply associated resources to a given open test form and preview their application.
    At that point we already know the test type.

Add ability to select samples in samples-listing.

Q: How to compute the "day" to be displayed on tests or samples?
  Is it an attribute of the sample or a test?

Components
----------
test-metadata
  input param: LabTestMetadata
  test metadata displayed horizontally

sample-overview
  material card
      sample info in card header
      vertical stacked test-metadata list in card content.
  component attribute params for test filtering: include-completed test-types

  Put samples assigned to the current user first.

  List sample information and active test links, with "+" to create new test.
  DO NOT use a data table.  Just use a custom sample component.
  Functions
    Show "day" of sample calculated from begin date.
    Import active samples and their employee work assignments from FACTS.
    List currently active samples for the lab, activate and deactivate samples.
    Make a named sample list from selected samples.
    Allow searching samples by name/pattern, date range for various dates, user, sample list.

[T] list/manage active tests
  When selection is non-empty:
    Enable dialog to receive pasted resources to associate with selected tests.
    Enable printing of test/sample information for association resources offline (via barcode scanner).
  edit test data
  review signoff and FACTS submission (requires special REVIEW role)
  print test data
  delete tests

[TR] receive stream of test/lab resource associations
     Support receiving alternating sequence of sample-codes and resource codes to form associations:
     ________  test code __________ resource code ___________
       |   |_______________|  |______________________|   |
       |_________________________________________________|
  In either case (1 or 2), present a matrix showing resources x tests for confirmation before saving the associations.
  Allow user to drag selected resources in a column to another column to correct associations (previous values at drop
  target go to holding area).

[WB] Waterbath whiteboard
  Add general screen to display samples/tests and attach status notes.

[R] manage lab resources
  usual crud ops

[MU] manage employees/users for user's lab group
  usual crud ops

[MLG] manage lab groups

[MTRA] manage test/lab-resource associations (managed and unmanaged)


[dto and ui] Each test view should be able to know the tests current stage, and optionally show each stage's data contents individually.
  + StagedLabTest interface
      stages: string[]
      currentStage: string
  UI will allow flipping through stages for a test.
  Grid of active tests will just show current stages by default.



Forms
  For each boolean choice, form should include a yes/no or pos/neg radio group with same form field name and values 'Y'/'N' or '+'/-'.
    Hopefully this will map naturally to the json field value of null/'+'/'-' etc.
