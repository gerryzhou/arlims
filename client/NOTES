Finish impl of filtering by sample op status code in main listing.
  Files:
    samples-listing.component.ts
    samples-listing-options.component.ts
    listing-options.ts

samples-listing.component.ts
In main sample listing UI, allow easy filters by status code.
  See "Select with multiple selection" at https://material.angular.io/components/select/overview

Add controls for:
   Vitek, API20E
     Record result code and identification conclusion (for each?).  Allow attaching output results file.
   PFGE/Serology/WGS results
     Just narrative text box for now.
   Controls

From meeting 2018/10/15
  - (app) Add button to immediately refresh from FACTS.
  - Try barcode scanners with new laptops, decide if new barcode scanners are needed.


Allow searching for sample information for a given lot # of a reagent (media).

Add data refresh button in main view.

Add ability to associate test files with particular fields, add icons next to field when attached file(s) are present.

Commit Notes

------------

Audit log section of form review report
  Data changes table alignment needs tweaking.
    Use common table for diffs across sections.
    Prevent some to-values from moving to far right.
  Maybe shorten some field names in deep paths, e.g. in positive continuations data, "rvSourcedTests" => "rv".


Try linking to specific section(s) in BAM for each stage.

Pre enr - Maybe make user have to choose to enter values manually for sampling manually.
  Could just disable the sampling detail fields unless user selects an other/custom toggle.
  Run this by John again, he seemed to maybe be OK with it as it is after some discussion.

BAM Integration
   Maybe pick food etc and restrict sampling method choices based on food and BAM.

Maybe print out labels for plates and tubes, which are different from media labels.


Q: What sort of medium type codes will be the prefix for BG, I2KI batches?

Vidas Stage
   Sample detections
      Allow pasting in results or loading from file (see Vidas results output).


Each test needs to be able to allow free-form entry of "continuation page".

Add filters to samples listing.

Maybe allow locking each test section.

TestsService.saveTestData
   Make sure that null value can conflict with non-null value.

Research API, try updating samples from FACTS.

Add ability to attach files to a sample and/or test.

test data entry component
-------------------------
  Allow pasting resource codes to be automatically matched to form fields by type.
  button to apply resources
    Highlight application points in the form.
    Distinguish applied resource codes from those that didn't match any form fields.


Decide how signatures in forms will be handled.
  They can't be handled like other form data, both components must be set automatically only when user passes an authentication test.
  Probably only the form stage should be signable as complete/correct and achieved outside the form?


[SL] Samples Listing

[WB] Water bath whiteboard
  Add general screen to display samples/tests and attach status notes.

[R] manage lab resources
  usual crud ops

[MU] manage employees/users for user's lab group
  usual crud ops

[MLG] manage lab groups

[MTRA] manage test/lab-resource associations (managed and unmanaged)


[dto and ui] Each test view should be able to know the tests current stage, and optionally show each stage's data contents individually.
  + StagedLabTest interface
      stages: string[]
      currentStage: string
  UI will allow flipping through stages for a test.
  Grid of active tests will just show current stages by default.

Create a new service for setting page title in center of toolbar, use this to hold sample listing page title, "Samples".


Forms
  For each boolean choice, form should include a yes/no or pos/neg radio group with same form field name and values 'Y'/'N' or '+'/-'.
    Hopefully this will map naturally to the json field value of null/'+'/'-' etc.

.flexbox-ex {
   display: flex;
   flex-flow: row wrap;
   justify-content: flex-start; // main axis: flex-start/end, center, space-around, space-between, space-evenly
   align-items: stretch;        // cross axis: stretch, center, flex-start, flex-end
}
