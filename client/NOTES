UserContextService
   Expose ReplaySubject's (buffer size = 1) for the LG and its dependent data (maps).
   These RS's won't be replaced, just call next() on them as part of loading process.
   Create a new type to represent data given to test data entry components, in addition to VersionedTestData.
   In imp slm vidas resolver, flatmap accesses from user context service and to make this new structure.

TestsService.saveTestData
   Null value should be able to conflict with non-null value.
   Implement conflict handling in save method for imp sal test data.
      Add fields and method to show conflicting values when auto-merging isn't possible.
   Force reload of user context info on next access when test is saved.

Can disable expansion panel header when only showing a single stage?


test data entry component
-------------------------
  Allow pasting resource codes to be automatically matched to form fields by type.
  dialog to paste codes
  button to apply resources
    Highlight application points in the form.
    Distinguish applied resource codes from those that didn't match any form fields.

Add convenience buttons to allow filling sampling method values with those from the test config.

Allow creating a new empty test of a given type in UI for selected sample(s).
  Test data field and status fields should be null.
  Should have to enter test begin date (TEST.BEGIN_DATE in db) from which day numbers are calculated.

Decide how signatures in forms will be handled.
  They can't be handled like other form data, both components must be set automatically only when user passes an authentication test.
  Probably only the form stage should be signable as complete/correct and achieved outside the form?

John: For now, don't use resource lists, just allow pasting directly to a form section after clicking on a test stage.
      So, may not need multiple selection at all, for now.
      If selection is needed, it would probably be selection of tests not samples, for example to apply some data to
      multiple tests at once.

[SL] Samples Listing
---------------

[WB] Waterbath whiteboard
  Add general screen to display samples/tests and attach status notes.

[R] manage lab resources
  usual crud ops

[MU] manage employees/users for user's lab group
  usual crud ops

[MLG] manage lab groups

[MTRA] manage test/lab-resource associations (managed and unmanaged)


[dto and ui] Each test view should be able to know the tests current stage, and optionally show each stage's data contents individually.
  + StagedLabTest interface
      stages: string[]
      currentStage: string
  UI will allow flipping through stages for a test.
  Grid of active tests will just show current stages by default.

Create a new service for setting page title in center of toolbar, use this to hold sample listing page title, "Samples".


Forms
  For each boolean choice, form should include a yes/no or pos/neg radio group with same form field name and values 'Y'/'N' or '+'/-'.
    Hopefully this will map naturally to the json field value of null/'+'/'-' etc.

.flexbox-ex {
   display: flex;
   flex-flow: row wrap;
   justify-content: flex-start; // main axis: flex-start/end, center, space-around, space-between, space-evenly
   align-items: stretch;        // cross axis: stretch, center, flex-start, flex-end
}
