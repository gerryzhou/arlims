Finish defining test data structure for imp slm test.

Allow creating a new empty test of a given type in UI for selected sample(s).
  Should have to enter test begin date (TEST.BEGIN_DATE in db) from which day numbers are calculated.

Create a component for each test stage via ng cli.
  stage-prep
  stage-pre-enr
  ...

Add router entries for test-data-entry component view.
  Url: tests/micro/imp-sal-vidas/123/PRE-ENR (following general pattern tests/<some form of the test type>/<test-id>/<stage-name>)
  Resolver: Resolve "versionedTestData" supplied by TestDataResolver.

In test.component.html:
  switch to select one test stage component to show.

In TestDataEntryComponent:
   Implement initialization:
      Get testId from url param.
         Lookup Sample via new method getTestMetadata(testId) in UserContextService which keeps mapping to test id -> { Sample, TestMetadata or test index within Sample}.
      Get optional stage from url param.
      Get VersionedTestData supplied by resolver.
      [Maybe, Future] Can ask if there is a set of resource codes in context via a new CurrentResourceCodes context.
        Would allow specifying codes for use in a sequence of test stage edits.
        resourceCodes: string[] | null

Implement details of test.component.html:
    Layout:
      sample information header
      control row, allowing to navigate and/or toggle visible stages
      form data for the currently selected stage(s)
      resource codes panel shown on right if supplied
          allow pasting in new resource codes
          button to apply resources
            Highlight application points in the form.
            Distinguish applied resource codes from those that didn't match any form fields.

IMP SLM test data structure should be factored into stages with mapping between field name and stage name.

John: For now, don't use resource lists, just allow pasting directly to a form section after clicking on a test stage.
      So, may not need multiple selection at all, for now.
      If selection is needed, it would probably be selection of tests not samples, for example to apply some data to
      multiple tests at once.

[SL] Samples Listing
---------------

[WB] Waterbath whiteboard
  Add general screen to display samples/tests and attach status notes.

[R] manage lab resources
  usual crud ops

[MU] manage employees/users for user's lab group
  usual crud ops

[MLG] manage lab groups

[MTRA] manage test/lab-resource associations (managed and unmanaged)


[dto and ui] Each test view should be able to know the tests current stage, and optionally show each stage's data contents individually.
  + StagedLabTest interface
      stages: string[]
      currentStage: string
  UI will allow flipping through stages for a test.
  Grid of active tests will just show current stages by default.

Create a new service for setting page title in center of toolbar, use this to hold sample listing page title, "Samples".


Forms
  For each boolean choice, form should include a yes/no or pos/neg radio group with same form field name and values 'Y'/'N' or '+'/-'.
    Hopefully this will map naturally to the json field value of null/'+'/'-' etc.

.flexbox-ex {
   display: flex;
   flex-flow: row wrap;
   justify-content: flex-start; // main axis: flex-start/end, center, space-around, space-between, space-evenly
   align-items: stretch;        // cross axis: stretch, center, flex-start, flex-end
}
