IMP SLM test data structure should be factored into stages with mapping between field name and stage name.
  "PRE-ENR" -> field preEnr


[ETAS] Edit Test at Stage
-------------------------
Required data:
   testId: number (lookup Sample via new method in UserContextService which keeps mapping to test id -> { Sample, Test }
   stage: string
   [via new TestDataResolver]
     test data json for the given test id
[Maybe, Future] Can ask if there is a set of resource codes in context via a new CurrentResourceCodes context.
   Would allow specifying codes for use in a sequence of test stage edits.
   resourceCodes: string[] | null

Layout:
  sample information header
  control row, allowing to navigate and/or toggle visible stages
  form data for the currently selected stage(s)
  resource codes panel shown on right if supplied
      allow pasting in new resource codes
      button to apply resources
        Highlight application points in the form.
        Distinguish applied resource codes from those that didn't match any form fields.

John: For now, don't use resource lists, just allow pasting directly to a form section after clicking on a test stage.
      So, may not need multiple selection at all, for now.
      If selection is needed, it would probably be selection of tests not samples, for example to apply some data to
      multiple tests at once.

[SL] Samples Listing
---------------
New filtering options:
  - by FACTS status
  - by test type (maybe optional whether to actually hide other test types in samples that contain the specified test type)

Hide slider switch to allow hidden selections by default, make available in some sort of "advanced options" panel.



Create a new service for setting page title in center of toolbar, use this to hold sample listing page title, "Samples".


[WB] Waterbath whiteboard
  Add general screen to display samples/tests and attach status notes.

[R] manage lab resources
  usual crud ops

[MU] manage employees/users for user's lab group
  usual crud ops

[MLG] manage lab groups

[MTRA] manage test/lab-resource associations (managed and unmanaged)


[dto and ui] Each test view should be able to know the tests current stage, and optionally show each stage's data contents individually.
  + StagedLabTest interface
      stages: string[]
      currentStage: string
  UI will allow flipping through stages for a test.
  Grid of active tests will just show current stages by default.



Forms
  For each boolean choice, form should include a yes/no or pos/neg radio group with same form field name and values 'Y'/'N' or '+'/-'.
    Hopefully this will map naturally to the json field value of null/'+'/'-' etc.

.flexbox-ex {
   display: flex;
   flex-flow: row wrap;
   justify-content: flex-start; // main axis: flex-start/end, center, space-around, space-between, space-evenly
   align-items: stretch;        // cross axis: stretch, center, flex-start, flex-end
}
