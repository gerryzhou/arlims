Resources Association Dialog
----------------------------
Validate and save assocations to database.
  Maybe add dialog option to eliminate duplicates?


Samples Listing
---------------
When one or more samples are selected, allow creating new resources association list (go to new ERL view).

Create a new service for setting page title in center of toolbar, use this to hold sample listing page title, "Samples".

[SRA] Manage a simple association of a samples list with a resources list (where each sample will have the same associated resources)
   Needed data:
     Resolver:
       Will return data of the form: { sampleIds: number[]; resourceCodes: string[] }.
       Inject UserContextService and SelectedSamplesService.
       if emp id not provided, get from user context service.
       samples with empty resource codes list.

   List samples on the left as table showing basic metadata (include list of open test types).
   List resource items on right as editable mat-chip-list.
   Allow pasting in new resource items or sample-items sequence to add new associations.

[MRL] Manage Resource Lists
   Listing of resource lists and their metadata (who created, when, number of items).
   Editing and delete link.


[S] list/manage active samples
 Include Samples Assigned to: list of checkboxes
 Sort Samples
   [x] assigned to current user (this checkbox only shown if assigned user is "any"), then
   (.)last modified test ()begin date  ...
 Filter test types: [x]IMP-SLM-VIDAS [x]DOM-SLM ...
 [Refresh sample info from FACTS]

 | -------------------------------------------------
 | Product Name, Sample #, PAC (LID PAF) Assigned to
 | -------------------------------------------------
 | sel  TEST TYPE     Day  Stage
 | [x]  IMP-SAL-VIDAS  3   Vidas
 | [ ]  DOM-SAL        2   Pre-Enrichment
 |----------------------------------------

  Put samples assigned to the current user first.

  List sample information and active test links, with "+" to create new test.
  DO NOT use a data table.  Just use a custom sample component.
  Functions
    Show "day" of sample calculated from begin date.
    Import active samples and their employee work assignments from FACTS.
    List currently active samples for the lab, activate and deactivate samples.
    Make a named sample list from selected samples.
    Allow searching samples by name/pattern, date range for various dates, user, sample list.

[T] list/manage active tests
  When selection is non-empty:
    Enable dialog to receive pasted resources to associate with selected tests.
    Enable printing of test/sample information for association resources offline (via barcode scanner).
  edit test data
  review signoff and FACTS submission (requires special REVIEW role)
  print test data
  delete tests

[TR] receive stream of test/lab resource associations
     Support receiving alternating sequence of sample-codes and resource codes to form associations:
     ________  test code __________ resource code ___________
       |   |_______________|  |______________________|   |
       |_________________________________________________|
  In either case (1 or 2), present a matrix showing resources x tests for confirmation before saving the associations.
  Allow user to drag selected resources in a column to another column to correct associations (previous values at drop
  target go to holding area).

[WB] Waterbath whiteboard
  Add general screen to display samples/tests and attach status notes.

[R] manage lab resources
  usual crud ops

[MU] manage employees/users for user's lab group
  usual crud ops

[MLG] manage lab groups

[MTRA] manage test/lab-resource associations (managed and unmanaged)


[dto and ui] Each test view should be able to know the tests current stage, and optionally show each stage's data contents individually.
  + StagedLabTest interface
      stages: string[]
      currentStage: string
  UI will allow flipping through stages for a test.
  Grid of active tests will just show current stages by default.



Forms
  For each boolean choice, form should include a yes/no or pos/neg radio group with same form field name and values 'Y'/'N' or '+'/-'.
    Hopefully this will map naturally to the json field value of null/'+'/'-' etc.

.flexbox-ex {
   display: flex;
   flex-flow: row wrap;
   justify-content: flex-start; // main axis: flex-start/end, center, space-around, space-between, space-evenly
   align-items: stretch;        // cross axis: stretch, center, flex-start, flex-end
}
