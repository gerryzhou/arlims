Add test stage statuses example data and test stage statuses display.

Test Metadata
-------------
Show stage statuses
   Row Layout: [Test name] [Day: ...] [stage statuses] [last saved]

Sample
------
Show associated resource lists.
  Allow viewing/editing resource lists.

Samples Listing
---------------
Allow toggling visibility of tests under samples.
  Collapse/expand all tests button.
  Collapse/expand each test by clicking within the sample header.
Add end of each sample row, show test count button stacked ("n tests","show/hide").
  Button toggles test visibility.
Add support for multiple selection of samples.
  As set of sample ids in controllers.

Set flex layout in listing options toolbar, add spacing around items.

Create a new service for setting page title in center of toolbar, use this to hold sample listing page title, "Samples".


Views

[S] list/manage active samples
 Include Samples Assigned to: list of checkboxes
 Sort Samples

  Put samples assigned to the current user first.

  List sample information and active test links, with "+" to create new test.
  DO NOT use a data table.  Just use a custom sample component.
  Functions
    Show "day" of sample calculated from begin date.
    Import active samples and their employee work assignments from FACTS.
    List currently active samples for the lab, activate and deactivate samples.
    Make a named sample list from selected samples.
    Allow searching samples by name/pattern, date range for various dates, user, sample list.

[T] list/manage active tests
  When selection is non-empty:
    Enable dialog to receive pasted resources to associate with selected tests.
    Enable printing of test/sample information for association resources offline (via barcode scanner).
  edit test data
  review signoff and FACTS submission (requires special REVIEW role)
  print test data
  delete tests

[TR] receive stream of test/lab resource associations
     Support receiving alternating sequence of sample-codes and resource codes to form associations:
     ________  test code __________ resource code ___________
       |   |_______________|  |______________________|   |
       |_________________________________________________|
  In either case (1 or 2), present a matrix showing resources x tests for confirmation before saving the associations.
  Allow user to drag selected resources in a column to another column to correct associations (previous values at drop
  target go to holding area).

[WB] Waterbath whiteboard
  Add general screen to display samples/tests and attach status notes.

[R] manage lab resources
  usual crud ops

[MU] manage employees/users for user's lab group
  usual crud ops

[MLG] manage lab groups

[MTRA] manage test/lab-resource associations (managed and unmanaged)


[dto and ui] Each test view should be able to know the tests current stage, and optionally show each stage's data contents individually.
  + StagedLabTest interface
      stages: string[]
      currentStage: string
  UI will allow flipping through stages for a test.
  Grid of active tests will just show current stages by default.



Forms
  For each boolean choice, form should include a yes/no or pos/neg radio group with same form field name and values 'Y'/'N' or '+'/-'.
    Hopefully this will map naturally to the json field value of null/'+'/'-' etc.

.flexbox-ex {
   display: flex;
   flex-flow: row wrap;
   justify-content: flex-start; // main axis: flex-start/end, center, space-around, space-between, space-evenly
   align-items: stretch;        // cross axis: stretch, center, flex-start, flex-end
}
