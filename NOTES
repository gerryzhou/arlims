  Queries are custom sql yielding json.
  For dto's transferred from client to server, use bean validation annotations.

Functionality
-------------
Samples List
  No current user, instead each signoff action requires authentication.
  Typeahead/live search filtering.
  User selection for filtering by sample assignments.

Allow entering/editing equipment, associating with analysts.

  Forms
    For each boolean choice, form should include a yes/no or pos/neg radio group with same form field name and values 'Y'/'N' or '+'/-'.
      Hopefully this will map naturally to the json field value of null/'+'/'-' etc.
