# Test password auth:
POST http://localhost:8080/ARLIMS/api/auth/password
Accept: application/json
Cache-Control: no-cache
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded

username=SCH1&password=123

###

Create authentication-related dto types
    +AuthenticationController
      authenticate(username, password)
        Lookup username in db (short_name).
        Hash posted password, compare with password from db.
        Return auth result structure.


Login Page
  Create Angular authentication service.
    + authenticate
    Post user (short) name and password to web service, emit authentication result event.
    Either store authentication result in the controller or to local storage.
  Create login form component, with auth service injected.
    Subscribe to auth events.
    If successful, route to home, else show an alert that authentication failed.

Home
  Requires login.
    Logged in employee determines the lab group for the app globally.
  Choice of tests determined from the lab group.
  List of recent test activity for the user/lab group.

Imported Salmonella Vidas test view.
  Create form via css grid.


Write service to fetch sample assignments for all users of a given facility, optionally limited to those for a given user and date range.
Write service to fetch form data for a given test type and sample, pack.
  Return as lab_test struct.
  If no existing record is found, create a new one with empty test as json. Null last_saved/by fields will indicate that it's new.
Write service to store form data for a given test type and sample, pack, and user (for last_saved_by).

App Pages
---------
  Login
    On successful authentication:
        Retrieve lab group and other users in the same lab group, set these in user context service.
        Redirect to home.
  Home
    Search box for tests/samples.
    Show tests in progress for the current user or all users in the lab group, or by test type.
    Show current sample assignments for the user or all users in the lab group.
      Show attached list of available tests registered for the lab group to allow starting a test for this sample.
    Show general list of tests for the lab group for starting a new test with manually entered sample info.



Query Rick about Sample/PAC combinations, work requests etc.
  Q: What is PAC code?
  Q: How are samples assigned to employees? (PAC specified?)
  Q: Should we have an employee id separate from the FACTS employee id?




Angular Services
----------------
[Current]EmployeeService
  State:
    Employee record for logged in employee.
    Lab group name.
    Employee records for all employees in the lab group.


Vidas Data Retrieval
--------------------
QR Codes
  https://davidshimjs.github.io/qrcodejs/
    Standalone, lightweight, not sure about QR code sizes supported.
  https://demos.shieldui.com/web/qrcode/basic-usage
    Depends on jquery and shieldui, supports all sizes of QR codes.
    http://demos.shieldui.com/web/qrcode/api
  Version 40 bar code with 1276 bytes of data:
    https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/251062/how-many-bytes-can-i-fit-into-a-qr-code-with-low-error-correction

Make a grid of QR codes for input text data.
  Try inline block layout for the qr codes.
  Divide data into fixed size chunks, encode each.

Questions
---------
Are jars and bags disposable or to be entered into database for display in dropdown lists?

For John:
  Is subs per comp always num comps / num subs (each sub assigned into exactly one composite)?
    extracted_grams_per_sub, num_subs, num_comps, comp_grams, num_subs_per_comp
    Need to capture deviations via note? Or capture count of subs within each component?
  Is it necessary to carry around pack code with the sample id everywhere?
    I've designed this way, but want to check that this is really necessary.




Hardware
--------
  laptops
  batching barcode scanners.
    https://www.zebra.com/us/en/support-downloads/mobile-computers/handheld/mc9090-wm.html


Functionality
-------------
Samples List
  No current user, instead each signoff action requires authentication.
  Typeahead/live search filtering.
  User selection for filtering by sample assignments.

Waterbath whiteboard
    Add general screen to query for samples for a given test type and/or time period, and attach timestamped notes easily.

Allow entering/editing equipment, associating with analysts.

  Forms
    For each boolean choice, form should include a yes/no or pos/neg radio group with same form field name and values 'Y'/'N' or '+'/-'.
      Hopefully this will map naturally to the json field value of null/'+'/'-' etc.
