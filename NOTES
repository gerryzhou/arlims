Send email of priorities with estimated completion times to John next week sometime.
  multi-sample data entry
  FACTS writing
  overflow inbox
    Maybe just add a "handoff" (or similar) flag to sample op and add search filter support.

Prep stage
  Should access new api to list sample transfers from custodian, to let user pick a line, to set received-from person and timestamp.
  Sample received from/date should come from FACTS via Leidos api, as general metadata about the sample (maybe embed in sample op).
    Should be a drop down with lab group users (sample custodians) plus other choice.
    Should be displayed read-only in form at same place as current controls.
    John suggests adding Sample custodian as a group.
      Maybe rename ADMIN to LIMS_ADMIN.
      Also supervisor role.

Implement "lab inbox" management over the api directly.
  Then sample/assignment data is always current during management ops which is necessary anyway.


Spring Reverse Proxy Setup using Spring Cloud / Zuul

JWT Invalidation
----------------
  Make user cache safe for concurrent use, maybe replace.
  Add a mechanism to tell the server to flush the user cache (in UserContextManager) for a given user or all users.
  Add disabled field to employee and AppUser.
  Have jwt recognizer check whether the user is disabled.


Data Access
-----------
Decide whether to proceed with JPA.
  Try QueryDSL code generation from db.
    http://www.querydsl.com/static/querydsl/4.1.3/reference/html_single/#sql_integration
    Spring Integration: http://www.querydsl.com/static/querydsl/4.1.3/reference/html_single/#d0e1449
Try implementing dummy header-based security, using Spring security filter.
  Using IE, is any SSO header available at the server? No

QR Codes
  https://davidshimjs.github.io/qrcodejs/
    Standalone, lightweight, not sure about QR code sizes supported.
  https://demos.shieldui.com/web/qrcode/basic-usage
    Depends on jquery and shieldui, supports all sizes of QR codes.
    http://demos.shieldui.com/web/qrcode/api
  Version 40 bar code with 1276 bytes of data:
    https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/251062/how-many-bytes-can-i-fit-into-a-qr-code-with-low-notice-correction

Make a grid of QR codes for input text data.
  Try inline block layout for the qr codes.
  Divide data into fixed size chunks, encode each.

Questions
---------
Are jars and bags disposable or to be entered into database for display in dropdown lists?

For John:
  Is subs per comp always num comps / num subs (each sub assigned into exactly one composite)?
    extracted_grams_per_sub, num_subs, num_comps, comp_grams, num_subs_per_comp
    Need to capture deviations via note? Or capture count of subs within each component?
  Is it necessary to carry around pack code with the sample id everywhere?
    I've designed this way, but want to check that this is really necessary.
