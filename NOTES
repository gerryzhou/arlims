Positive Samples Workflow
-------------------------
Add as optional "Plates" stage before "Wrapup".
  Don't report this stage if all Vidas results were negative (or alternately, unless some result is positive).
  Or add another stage status code meaning not-applicable.


One plate test expandable section or tab per positive composite.
  If expandable section, collapsed if not started or all finished.
  If tab, should show some sort of status about plate stage and/or when last modified.
  Content is a view showing the latest stage (only) of HE, XLD, BS plate testing in a row display.
    Expandable to show full history for each plate (individually?)


One complete workflow per test unit.
One set of controls no matter how many test units were positive.
  Need more detail about which stages have controls.
For each composite c:
For each incubation media m:
For each kind of selective agar plate a:
  Initially we have a plate for (c,m,a), through the stage of making call on Typical/Atypical vs. Not Typical/No Growth (p.2 middle)
  E.g.: For Composite #3, RV orig inc. media, agar plate BS: Typical
If Typical/Atypical call, then for each (c,m,a):
For each isolate # i:
  We do a TSI test and LIA slant tube tests on (c,a,m,i).
  And record results for Slant, Butt, H2S and Gas (see table for valid results).

Another 2 controls have to be specified for page 3, one for oxidase and one for api/vitek.



New Feature Soon for Demo
-------------------------
Allow searching for sample information for a given lot # of a reagent (media).


Work Done
---------
Pdf report
  Support any number of subs/composites results.
  Add audit log.
  Customize display of some fields, with red highlight for exceptional values.

Deployed to dev and test servers.
  Systemd installation, custom unpriv user, properties-file driven, logging etc.
  Removed Tomcat dependency.

Sample refresh from FACTS
  Syncing algorithm basically finished, needs final testing.
  Problem reporting to Oracle table as well as app logs.
  Samples assigned to unregistered employees are assigned to administrative lab group.



Implement "lab inbox" management over the api directly.
  Then sample/assignment data is always current during management ops which is necessary anyway.


Pushing data into FACTS
  Lower priority for now.


Spring Reverse Proxy Setup using Spring Cloud / Zuul
  https://spring.io/guides/tutorials/spring-security-and-angular-js/



JWT Invalidation
----------------
  Make user cache safe for concurrent use, maybe replace.
  Add a mechanism to tell the server to flush the user cache (in UserContextManager) for a given user or all users.
  Add disabled field to employee and AppUser.
  Have jwt recognizer check whether the user is disabled.


Data Access
-----------
Decide whether to proceed with JPA.
  Try QueryDSL code generation from db.
    http://www.querydsl.com/static/querydsl/4.1.3/reference/html_single/#sql_integration
    Spring Integration: http://www.querydsl.com/static/querydsl/4.1.3/reference/html_single/#d0e1449
Try implementing dummy header-based security, using Spring security filter.
  Using IE, is any SSO header available at the server? No


# Example api calls

GET http://localhost:8080/alis/api/user/context
Accept: application/json
Cache-Control: no-cache

Vidas Data Retrieval
--------------------
QR Codes
  https://davidshimjs.github.io/qrcodejs/
    Standalone, lightweight, not sure about QR code sizes supported.
  https://demos.shieldui.com/web/qrcode/basic-usage
    Depends on jquery and shieldui, supports all sizes of QR codes.
    http://demos.shieldui.com/web/qrcode/api
  Version 40 bar code with 1276 bytes of data:
    https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/251062/how-many-bytes-can-i-fit-into-a-qr-code-with-low-notice-correction

Make a grid of QR codes for input text data.
  Try inline block layout for the qr codes.
  Divide data into fixed size chunks, encode each.

Questions
---------
Are jars and bags disposable or to be entered into database for display in dropdown lists?

For John:
  Is subs per comp always num comps / num subs (each sub assigned into exactly one composite)?
    extracted_grams_per_sub, num_subs, num_comps, comp_grams, num_subs_per_comp
    Need to capture deviations via note? Or capture count of subs within each component?
  Is it necessary to carry around pack code with the sample id everywhere?
    I've designed this way, but want to check that this is really necessary.
