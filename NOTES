QR Codes
  https://davidshimjs.github.io/qrcodejs/
    Standalone, lightweight, not sure about QR code sizes supported.
  https://demos.shieldui.com/web/qrcode/basic-usage
    Depends on jquery and shieldui, supports all sizes of QR codes.
    http://demos.shieldui.com/web/qrcode/api
  Version 40 bar code with 1276 bytes of data:
    https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/251062/how-many-bytes-can-i-fit-into-a-qr-code-with-low-error-correction

Make a grid of QR codes for input text data.
  Try inline block layout for the qr codes.
  Divide data into fixed size chunks, encode each.

Questions
---------
Are jars and bags disposable or to be entered into database for display in dropdown lists?

For John:
  Is subs per comp always num comps / num subs (each sub assigned into exactly one composite)?
    extracted_grams_per_sub, num_subs, num_comps, comp_grams, num_subs_per_comp
    Need to capture deviations via note? Or capture count of subs within each component?
  Is it necessary to carry around pack code with the sample id everywhere?
    I've designed this way, but want to check that this is really necessary.



Client/Server Project Skeletons
-------------------------------
Add lab_group or domain (MBIO|CHEM) to test type table and maybe other tables.
Make Java model classes.
Code generation strategy
  Just define dto types in java to match desired results, generate typescript defs from these.
  Maybe generate api doc via https://www.vojtechruzicka.com/documenting-spring-boot-rest-api-swagger-springfox/
Make sure mvn package creates proper typescript dto interfaces.
Create schema objects in Oracle.
Decide jdbi vs Spring jdbc.
Write service to fetch sample assignments for all users of a given facility, optionally limited to those for a given user and date range.
Write service to fetch form data for a given test type and sample, pack.
  Return as lab_test struct.
  If no existing record is found, create a new one with empty test as json. Null last_saved/by fields will indicate that it's new.
Write service to store form data for a given test type and sample, pack, and user (for last_saved_by).


Create client app.
Setup context path sync.
Setup code gen.




Hardware
--------
  laptops
  batching barcode scanners.
    https://www.zebra.com/us/en/support-downloads/mobile-computers/handheld/mc9090-wm.html


Functionality
-------------
Samples List
  No current user, instead each signoff action requires authentication.
  Typeahead/live search filtering.
  User selection for filtering by sample assignments.

Waterbath whiteboard
    Add general screen to query for samples for a given test type and/or time period, and attach timestamped notes easily.

Allow entering/editing equipment, associating with analysts.

  Forms
    For each boolean choice, form should include a yes/no or pos/neg radio group with same form field name and values 'Y'/'N' or '+'/-'.
      Hopefully this will map naturally to the json field value of null/'+'/'-' etc.
