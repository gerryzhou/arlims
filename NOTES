LABSDS API
==========
Data Submission Problems
  Test data
    My performingOrg not valid for the test data ops, has to be sent as null.
    Analytical assignment status is not 'I' for test ops I tried, so cannot submit AOAC data.
  lowestDilutionTestedCode
    Where to get this value?
  Spiking
    spikingGenusSpeciesText was added to config associated with the lab and test type.
      Should it be added to the ui for user to select/enter?
    kitRemarksText
      Value is required by api. Should this be added to the ui somewhere? Standardized per lab/test-type?
      Currently sending "7 CFUs on blood agar".
    Unknown fields (what are these, where to obtain values?)
      subsampleNumberCode
      selectiveAgarResultCode
      selectiveAgarText

[Requested] Add sorting by assigned date to person inbox.
Still need product description field added to SampleAnalyses endpoint results.

Sample data problems
  On test server:
    Analytical assignment status for sample 848447-0 is not 'I' so AOAC submission cannot be made.

Microbiology Data Submission

  BAM Findings questions
    Array element structure in analysisMicFindings:
      'subNumberCode': '1',     // Meaning? Original test unit num as in Vidas results? Or positives relative num? Really string not numeric?
         A: test unit number
      'genusCode': 'SLML',      // Why are these two necessary again here since they're specified in outer structure?
      'speciesCode': 'SLML998', //
      'presenceResultIndicator': 'POS', // (Q for John) How to determine? Would a negative be reported (with an array entry) at all?
      'atypicalReactionCode': 'N',      // (Q for John) Where from?
      'isolatesSentNumber': 1,          // (Q for John) Where from?
      'fdaLabOrganizationId': 3004,     // Why not org name as elsewhere?
      'isolatesSentIndicator': 'Y',     // (Q for John) Where from?
      'remarksText': 'Remarks 1',       // (Q for John) Where from?
      'sampleAnalysisMicrobes': []      // What is this?
      ---
    Example from Leidos email after John's visit:
      "analysisMicFindings":[
         {
           "actionIndicator": "Y",
           "subNumberCode": "1",
           "genusCode": "SLML",
           "speciesCode": "SLML998",
           "presenceResultIndicator": "POS",
           "atypicalReactionCode": "Y",
           "isolatesSentNumber": 1,
           "fdaLabOrganizationId": 3004,
           "isolatesSentIndicator": "Y",
           "remarksText": "Findings Remarks",
           "atypicalReactionRemarksText": "Atypical Remarks Required as 'Y' in Atypical Biochem React Field",
           "secondaryPafCode": "SAL",
           "sampleAnalysisMicrobes": []
         }
      ]

      Fields in email example which are not documented: secondaryPafCode, sampleAnalysisMicrobes.
      Documented fields not in example: levelCountNumber, levelUnitCode, levelQualifierIndicator.

FACTS Status Update
-------------------
  Need api endpoint to which to post status updates.
  Just added by Leidos as a PATCH operation.


TODO:
  Complete BAM submission work, mostly involving generation of finding structures from identifications data.
    How to determine pos/neg from identification text or codes? Recognize specific API/Vitek codes?  What if identifications are weak/uncertain?
      For each test unit with positive continuation tests, multiple identifications may have been made by media and selective agar.
      How to determine from these the single identification needed for the BAM submission for the test unit?
  Posting of lab accomplishment hours.
  Lookup of received-from information in prep stage.
  Status change (api endpoint still not available?)
  Implement proper per-stage validation and problem reporting.
  Stage completion sealing with signature.  Require admin override for further edits.
  Configure to run in Docker for cloud deployment, Java 11 + latest Spring framework.
    https://stackoverflow.com/questions/53669151/java-11-application-as-docker-image/53669152#53669152
  Implement proper reports according to Paul's package documentation.








Add impl for POST to status update ap in FactsController:
  /api/facts/sample-op/${opId}/status


Create accounts for Rick, Ash, Joseph, Wen, Paul.

Send email of priorities with estimated completion times to John next week sometime.
  multi-sample data entry
  FACTS writing
  overflow inbox

Prep stage
  Should access new api to list sample transfers from custodian, to let user pick a line, to set received-from person and timestamp.
  Sample received from/date should come from FACTS via Leidos api, as general metadata about the sample (maybe embed in sample op).
    Should be a drop down with lab group users (sample custodians) plus other choice.
    Should be displayed read-only in form at same place as current controls.
    John suggests adding Sample custodian as a group.
      Maybe rename ADMIN to LIMS_ADMIN.
      Also supervisor role.

Implement "lab inbox" management over the api directly.
  Then sample/assignment data is always current during management ops which is necessary anyway.

JWT Invalidation
----------------
  Make user cache safe for concurrent use, maybe replace.
  Add a mechanism to tell the server to flush the user cache (in UserContextManager) for a given user or all users.
  Add disabled field to employee and AppUser.
  Have jwt recognizer check whether the user is disabled.

Vidas Data Retrieval
--------------------
QR Codes
  https://davidshimjs.github.io/qrcodejs/
    Standalone, lightweight, not sure about QR code sizes supported.
  https://demos.shieldui.com/web/qrcode/basic-usage
    Depends on jquery and shieldui, supports all sizes of QR codes.
    http://demos.shieldui.com/web/qrcode/api
  Version 40 bar code with 1276 bytes of data:
    https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/251062/how-many-bytes-can-i-fit-into-a-qr-code-with-low-notice-correction

Make a grid of QR codes for input text data.
  Try inline block layout for the qr codes.
  Divide data into fixed size chunks, encode each.

Questions
---------
Are jars and bags disposable or to be entered into database for display in dropdown lists?

For John:
  Is subs per comp always num comps / num subs (each sub assigned into exactly one composite)?
    extracted_grams_per_sub, num_subs, num_comps, comp_grams, num_subs_per_comp
    Need to capture deviations via note? Or capture count of subs within each component?
  Is it necessary to carry around pack code with the sample id everywhere?
    I've designed this way, but want to check that this is really necessary.
